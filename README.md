**Plant Health Monitoring System - Lab Codes**

This repository consists of three distinct laboratory exercises—lab_1, lab_2, and lab_3—each designed to focus on different aspects of programming: system diagnostics, regression analysis, and genetic algorithms. Below are detailed descriptions and instructions for each lab.

**Lab 1: Gardening System Diagnostics**

**Description:**
Lab_1 features a Python script aimed at diagnosing plant health issues based on symptoms such as yellow leaves, brown tips, wilting, spots on leaves, and stunted growth. The script uses a series of diagnostic rules to simulate a gardening advisory system, helping users to understand potential plant health problems based on visual cues.

**How to Run:**
To execute the diagnostics, navigate to the `src` directory and run the gardening system script using Python. This script does not require any external libraries, making it easy to run with a basic Python setup.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8 or later

**Lab 2: Linear Regression via Gradient Descent**

**Description:**
Lab_2 demonstrates a basic implementation of linear regression using gradient descent. It includes a script that generates random data points, applies linear regression to predict outcomes, and visually represents these predictions along with the regression line using a scatter plot. This exercise is perfect for understanding the fundamentals of machine learning in data prediction.

**How to Run:**
Navigate to the `src` directory and run the linear regression script. This script will produce a graphical output showing the data points and the fitted line, highlighting the regression model's accuracy and performance.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8 or later
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

**Lab 3: Genetic Algorithm for Optimization**

**Description:**
In lab_3, a genetic algorithm is employed to optimize a mathematical function over a series of constraints. The script iteratively enhances a population of solutions using fitness assessments, crossover, and mutation techniques. This lab is an excellent demonstration of evolutionary algorithms used for solving optimization problems in complex scenarios.

**How to Run:**
To run the genetic algorithm simulation, execute the corresponding script in the `src` directory. The output will detail each generation's best fitness and the global best solution found during the simulation.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8 or later
